# Safe Device Ð¡hecker

## Problem 

Cybersecurity is now more important than ever. One of the urgent issues
there is the provision of protection of devices that have become an integral part
of our everyday life, for example, as baby monitors or smart appliances
machinery. A key factor is the need for producers to respond
higher standards of cyber security, and retailers -
sell secure devices. Currently, the user does not always know whether
his device is safe from the point of view of cyber security.

------

## Goal

Create a mobile application that will allow users
understand whether the device is safe from a cyber security point of view. Idea
is that a person searches or selects a type from a list
device, manufacturer and model. Next, the data is processed and
the user is shown a screen on which the table with
characteristics of the device and whether there is a potential threat
data leakage when using this device. It also has
a link to the source where existing cases are described should be displayed
breaking the protection of the device.
